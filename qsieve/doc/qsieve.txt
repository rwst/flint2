    Quadratic sieve

*******************************************************************************

mp_limb_t qsieve_ll_factor(mp_limb_t hi, mp_limb_t lo)

    Given an integer \code{n = (hi, lo)} find a factor and return it. 
    If a tiny factor is encountered, this is returned very quickly. 
    Otherwise the quadratic sieve algorithm is employed. The algorithm
    requires that $n$ not be prime and not be a perfect power. There is
    also a limit to the size of $n$. During the algorithm $n$ will be
    multiplied by a small multiplier $k$ (from 1 to 47). The product
    $kn$ must fit in two limbs. If not the algorithm will silently 
    fail, returning 0. Otherwise a factor of $n$ which fits in a single
    limb will be returned.
